description: Slowbridge had been shaken to its foundations. It may as well be explained,
  however, at the outset, that it would not take much of a sensation to give Slowbridge
  a great shock. In the first place, Slowbridge was not used to sensations, and was
  used to going on the even and respectable tenor of its way, regarding the outside
  world with private distrust, if not with open disfavor. The new mills had been a
  trial to Slowbridge, - a sore trial. On being told of the owners' plan of building
  them, old Lady Theobald, who was the corner-stone of the social edifice of Slowbridge,
  was said, by a spectator, to have turned deathly pale with rage; and, on the first
  day of their being opened in working order, she had taken to her bed, and remained
  shut up in her darkened room for a week, refusing to see anybody, and even going
  so far as to send a scathing message to the curate of St. James, who called in fear
  and trembling, because he was afraid to stay away. "With mills and mill-hands,"
  her ladyship announced to Mr. Laurence, the mill-owner, when chance first threw
  them together, "with mills and mill-hands come murder, massacre, and mob law."
